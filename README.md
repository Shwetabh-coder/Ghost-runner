<h3>1. Use spacebar to go up the tower and try not to fall of the screen <br>
2. Be careful of the enchanted thorns coming from above which are attached to a door <br>
3. You can stand on the upper part of the enchated thorns as a resting place, though remember those doors are going down the tower and you have to move away <br>
4. Collect as much points as you can while dodging the enchanted thorns</h3>
